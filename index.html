            <h1>Plane Boarding Simulation</h1>
            <i>Customizable simulation to find the efficiency of different boarding methods.</i><br/><br/>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                Reducing plane boarding times by just 10 minutes has been estimated to save airlines over 160 million dollars a year, while improving passenger experience. The standard method of boarding a plane has been shown to be highly inefficient in computer simulations and physical studies. The purpose of this project was to create a realistic computer simulation of passengers boarding a plane to identify which boarding method was the fastest. 4 boarding methods were tested - Free-for-All (passengers with assigned seats in random order), WILMA (window, middle, then aisle), Standard (back to front after first class), and Back-to-Front. Unlike previous studies, this project added real life scenarios like luggage stowing delays, seat blockage, and slow passengers into the computer simulation simultaneously.
